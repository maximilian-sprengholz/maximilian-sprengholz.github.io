# Violence Prevention Network Website Relaunch <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->

I created the initial design for the [Violence Prevention Network's](https://violence-prevention-network.de/ ':target=_blank') website relaunch. They are experts in extremism prevention and the deradicalization of extremist-motivated and radicalized youth and adults. The design directs different stakeholders to the information and counseling and training services that are appropriate for them, and invites visitors to donate.

Freelance work for [part](https://part.berlin/ ':target=_blank'), 2017.
