# Secret 7” Vinyl Covers <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->

Secret 7" is a charity initiative combining music and art: 7 iconic tracks from 7 of the world’s top musicians are pressed onto 7” vinyl a 100 times and artists from around the world are invited to design the corresponding sleeves. 700 curated, one-of-a-kind covers are showcased at a free exhibition before being auctioned off in support for a good cause. The first two covers interpret Peter Gabriel's "Sledgehammer," and the cover featuring the banana was included in the 2015 exhibition. The third design is an interpretation of Art School's "The Jam," and the fourth design is an interpretation of London Grammar's "Help," which was featured in the 2018 exhibition.
